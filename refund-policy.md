# Subscription Refunds

## Refund Eligibility
Daisuke's subscription plans are generally non-refundable. However, we understand that situations may arise where a refund could be appropriate. Please discuss with the Owner (via the contact methods listed in the Terms of Service) to see if you may be eligible for a refund.

## Cancellation Period
If you are not satisfied with your subscription plan, you may request a refund within 14 days from the date of initial subscription. After this period, refunds will not beg granted for subscription fees unless stated in writing by the Owner.

# Refund Process

Your refund request will be reviewed and its eligibility assessed based on the information provided and the terms of this Refund Policy.

## Refund Notification
We will notify you via email about the approval or rejection of your refund request.

A refund may be approved if your request meets one of the following criteria:  
* Significant technical issues with our services that cannot be resolved within a reasonable time frame.

* Subscription cancellation within the specified cancellation period.

## Refund Amount
If a refund is approved, the refund amount will be determined based on the unused portion of the subscription plan.
