It's understandable that you care about your privacy online: we all should, right?  
Here's what data Daisuke collects, how it's used and why.  
If you have any questions after reading through this, look at the information detailed at the bottom of this document as to how you can get in contact with a Daisuke Developer.

# What data is collected?

This solely depends on how you use Daisuke, however we aim to collect as little information as necessary in order to provide you with the best service possible.  

## If you are in a server where Daisuke has been invited:
You, as a user, are rarely ever going to have any data collected about you. In servers where Daisuke's message logging features are enabled, you'll find that any messages you delete or edit get logged in that server's logging channel.  
Note that no Daisuke Developer will have access to these messages, and they don't get stored anywhere else besides each individual server's logging channel.  

If you're a Server Owner and using Daisuke in your server, the only data that is collected about you and your server is the per-server configuration options: nothing identifying besides the server's unique Discord ID!

## If you take out a subscription plan:
Information such as your name, billing address, tax ID (if applicable), and payment information will be stored by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for future payments. Amethyst IT Solutions LTD partner with Stripe to provide a secure and efficient payment solution. You can find their privacy policy, and more information such as how long your information is stored, on their website: https://stripe.com/gb/privacy.

# I've deleted a message and want to make sure it's gone for good. How can I do that?

If there's certain messages that you want to be deleted, and there to be no trace of, please start by getting in contact with the Server Owner and asking them to delete the message from the logging channel. We'd hope they comply but in the event that they don't, please get in contact with a Daisuke Developer via the methods detailed at the bottom of this document.

If, for whatever reason you deem necessary, you want to opt-out and none of your edited/deleted messages be logged; contact Daisuke's Lead Developer via the methods detailed at the bottom of this document and it can be sorted out for you. Hopefully, sometime in the near future, we'll make this process easier via a command or other method, but we'll make do for now.

# Can I view any data collected about me? How do I go about requesting this data be deleted?

As stated above, no personal or user-specific data is collected by Daisuke Developers. Any logged messages are sent via Discord, and not stored anywhere else, so they will be stored for as long as Discord keeps messages & the server it was sent in is still around; until you start the process of requesting it to be deleted.

As a Server Owner, you're more than welcome to request that Daisuke be removed from your server, and the per-server configuration data be deleted from the database. Note that Daisuke won't be able to be in your server if you request this and adding Daisuke back into your server will result in data being collected again.\
To ensure this doesn't happen, Daisuke's Lead Developer may opt to blacklist your server so that everyone involved is notified that data collection may start again - before it actually happens.

# I'm a Server Owner, how is the data about my server being used?

The data collected regarding your server is the per-server configuration data. It's used to ensure features such as logging, auto-roles, permanent mutes, welcome and farewell messages all work as expected and to how you've configured it to be. The data regarding your server stays in the database indefinitely, from when you add Daisuke to your server. It will only be deleted if you request it to be deleted. This is to ensure that kicking and re-adding the bot (no matter how far away these events happen to be) doesn't result in you having to reconfigure Daisuke all over again.

# I've still got questions after reading this, how can I get in contact with a Daisuke Developer?

You can join [Daisuke's Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/RW5mrEh) and a Daisuke Developer will be more than happy to help you out from there!

If you prefer to use email, you can send an email to Daisuke's Lead Developer here: daisuke@amthst.dev.
